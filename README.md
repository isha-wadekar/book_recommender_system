Book Recommender System

Avid readers face a common problem of finding new books to read. They are always done reading the books they know and constantly seek new books that are to their liking. This book recommender system helps readers find books similar to a given book title. The recommender not only helps them finding books that suit their preferences but also helps them get the book that they are in mood for. 

This recommender system is capable of recommending the required number of books similar to a given book. The model developed in this project can also be used in the entertainment industry for movie/series recommendations with minimal changes.
